    <!-- QUESTION QUESTION
      I have two sibling elements which each contain dynamic content.
    In some cases sibling-1 will have more content then sibling-2 and vice versa. I would like the height of the second element sibling-2 always equal the height of the first sibling-1. If the height of sibling-2 is greater then the height of sibling-1 it will overflow the flex div and thus be scrollable.

Is there any way to accomplish this with Flexbox? -->
    <!-- 
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="sibling-1"></div>
      <div class="sibling-2"></div>
    </div> -->

    <!-- ANSVER ANSVER -->
    <!-- Yes, it is possible. Leave the sibling setting the max height alone and set the others' flex-basis: 0 and flex-grow: 1, which according to the spec will expand them to their sibling's height. No absolute positioning. No setting height on any elements. -->
